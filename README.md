# **Section 1: Project Overview**  
This project is an in-depth analysis of sales data from ValueFrenzy, a fictional supermarket chain operating in the FMCG sector across the USA, Mexico, and Canada. The goal was to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Gross Profit, Quantity Sold, Total Transactions, and Average Transaction Value (ATV) to uncover insights and provide recommendations for business growth. The analysis focused on historical sales data from 2021-2023, segmented by three major regions (USA, Mexico, Canada) and product tiers (low-tier like groceries, medium-tier like household goods, and high-tier like electronics). 

The objective of this project is to assist ValueFrenzy in understanding sales trends from 2021-2023, identify the root causes of declining revenue and profitability, and provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve operational efficiency and market competitiveness across its three regions: USA, Mexico, and Canada.

# **Section 2: Motivation**  
In the highly competitive FMCG industry, it is crucial to maintain strong profit margins while responding to shifting customer behaviors. This project aims to provide actionable insights that can help ValueFrenzy identify gaps and capitalize on opportunities to improve overall profitability and customer satisfaction.

# **Section 3: Data Sources**
The dataset used for this analysis was provided in CSV format, eliminating the need to use SQL for data retrieval. The data was imported directly into Power Query for cleaning, transformation, and modeling.

# **Section 4: Data Model**

The data model was created using Power Pivot to establish relationships between the fact table (sales data) and dimension tables (products, regions, and time periods). This data model is the backbone of the analysis and enables complex calculations and dynamic insights. It allows for slicing and dicing data in multiple dimensions for deeper analysis and visualization within the dashboard. The relationships are structured as follows:

# **Section 10: Lessons Learned**
Working on the ValueFrenzy data analysis project has been an invaluable experience, offering insights from various perspectives—technical, analytical, and strategic:

## ***1. Data Preparation and Cleaning:***
One of the key lessons was the importance of robust data cleaning and transformation. Handling messy, incomplete, and unstructured data required a deep dive into Power Query, which helped automate much of the cleaning process. I gained valuable experience in understanding the nuances of data quality issues and how to resolve them effectively.

## ***2. Working with Real-World Business Data:***
The data required not only cleaning but also thoughtful segmentation, such as breaking down information by product tiers and regions. Understanding the business logic behind the data was critical in making the right transformations and interpreting the results correctly.

## ***3. Defining Key Metrics and KPIs:***
Identifying the right KPIs—Total Revenue, Gross Profit, Quantity Sold, Total Transactions, and Average Transaction Value—taught me the importance of aligning analytical goals with business objectives. These KPIs formed the backbone of the analysis, and I learned how essential it is to communicate their impact clearly to stakeholders.
## ***4. Data Modeling and DAX Measures in Power Pivot:***
This project made me mindful of the fact that one should always set up a skeleton of the data model in order to visualize the relationships between Fact and Dimension Tables before even thinking of loading your data into the Power Query.
